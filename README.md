OA_Research_Filter
===========
OA_Research_Filter is a searching tool that utilizes the OpenAlex api to retrieve publications within the OpenAlex database.
Users may specify a keyword related to their subject of interest and the earliest year of publication they would like to 
see publications from. The interface returns ten publications sorted 1-10 based on the number of citations per year. The citations
per year metric is used to remove bias towards publications that have been in circulation for relatively long periods of time.
Overall, OA_Research_Filter is a tool that researchers can easily use to find publications from their field and related fields,
with the goal of giving focus to publications that are earning a high amount of citations per year.
